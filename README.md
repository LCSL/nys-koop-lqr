### Duffing oscillator

The code simulating the Duffing oscillator contains the Matlab implementation deployed by Milan Korda [https://homepages.laas.fr/mkorda/Eigfuns.zip], 
accompanying the paper "Optimal construction of Koopman eigenfunctions for prediction and control", M. Korda, I. Mézic, IEEE TAC, 2020.

### Cloth simulator
The implementation of the cloth simulation uses the Matlab code deployed by Franco Coltraro, accompanying the paper 
"An inextensible model for the robotic manipulation of textiles", F. Coltraro, J. Amorós, M. Alberich-Carramiñana, C. Torras, 
Applied Mathematical Modelling, 2022.

# Installation
The required packages can be installed by running the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

# Project files

### Duffing oscillator

The script ```benchmark_lqr_classic.py``` allows to compare the Nyström-Koopman regression with the spline-based 
competitor, on the Duffing oscillator simulation. The script allows to:
- cross-validate the regression hyperparameters (regularization constant, kernel lengthscale);
- validate the open-loop forecasts of the data-driven dynamical system;
- solve the LQR problem with the data-driven system, computing the optimal Riccati gain;
- test the state-feedback law with the real nonlinear system.

In order to evaluate the baseline based on Korda and Mézic, 2020, one needs to run the Matlab script ```Duffing.m```, located in
the directory ```eigfuns```.

The results of this simulation are available in the directory ```duffing```.

### Cloth manipulation

First of all, the training set for the cloth manipulation experiment can be generated by running the script ```simulation_cloth.m```,
located in the directory ```cloth_simulator```.

The script ```benchmark_lqr_cloth.py``` allows to compare the Nyström-Koopman regression with the spline-based 
competitor, on the cloth manipulation task. The script allows to:
- cross-validate the regression hyperparameters (regularization constant, kernel lengthscale);
- validate the open-loop forecasts of the data-driven dynamical system;
- solve the LQR problem with the data-driven system, computing the optimal Riccati gain.

In order to assess the closed-loop behavior with the state-feedback employing the Riccati gain, 
one can run the file ```closed_loop_lqr_control.m```, located in the directory ```cloth_simulator```.
The results of this simulation are located in the directory ```8x8_cloth_swing_xyz/sim_results```.

### Utilities

The file ```dynamical_systems.py``` contains the classes used to simulate the Duffing oscillator in Python.
The file ```regressors.py``` contains the Python implementation of the Nyström-Koopman estimator, the spline-based baseline,
and the kernels employed.

### Plotting

The plotting code for the open-loop RMSE can be found in ```plot_rmses_classic.py``` and ```plot_rmses_cloth.py```.
The plots for the LQR in the Duffing oscillator simulation can be generated by running the benchmarking file. The plots related
to the LQR in the cloth simulation can be generated by running ```plot_reg_error_cloth.py```.


### Proofs

The directory ```proofs``` contains the ```pdf``` files with the extended proofs of Lemma 5 and Theorem 7 in the main paper.
